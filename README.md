# Applied-Machine-Learning

Machine learning refers to the field of studying computer algorithms that improve by themselves through the use of data and experience. It is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) where a system learns from its experience and improves its performance without requiring much human intervention.

It is a compilation of all of my work completed during the course of my studies.
